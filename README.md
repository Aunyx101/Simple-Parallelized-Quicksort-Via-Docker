# Simple-Parallelized-Quicksort-Via-Docker
Quick Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array  around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quick Sort that pick pivot in different ways. In  this project, the algorithm will be implemented in parallel environment via Docker (note: this is a simple test project and no clustering is used).

The MPI code is present in the folder 'D1', the code is supposed to be used in a Docker environment.
